        <h3>Introduction.<br>
          As a person born and raised in Kerala, I have always been proud of my cultural roots and heritage. Growing up, I was exposed to the vibrant and diverse traditions of Kerala, including its food, music, and dance. I learned to appreciate the natural beauty of the state, with its picturesque landscapes and stunning backwaters. However, as I grew older, I realized that many people outside of Kerala were unaware of the richness and uniqueness of our culture.

          That's why I decided to create this website - to showcase the beauty and diversity of Kerala to the world. Through this platform, I hope to share my personal experiences and insights into the culture, history, and traditions of Kerala. I want to highlight the contributions of Kerala to the world, including its renowned literature, art, and music. By sharing my knowledge and passion for Kerala, I hope to inspire others to explore and appreciate this wonderful state, and to learn more about the people and culture that make it so special. </h3>
